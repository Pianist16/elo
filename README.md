# elo
The code for this project is written in python using mainly pandas library. This module calculates the Elo Rating based on the 2 columns supplied. Left column contains the ID of the winner and the right column - the loser in a given match. This algorithm can be applied to any sport/field where it is necessary to estimate the relative strength of a player/participant. It goes back to the Hungarian scientist Arpad Elo who came up with a formula and methodology that would give a single number to reflect the level of strength of a player. It has been widely accepted and implemented in various sports as a leading rating/ranking system.

development status: in development; first working prototype is ready; tested on the attached tennis data set.
